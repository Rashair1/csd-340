    <h2> Chapter 1: About Me

    <p class="intro"> Hello There. It's me, Rashai Robertson, and I'm here to introduce myself to you all. 
    Honestly I don't even know where to start. I guess this means that I'll start at the beginning.</p>

    <p> Obviously, my name is Rashai. I'm 27 years old. I grew up in Chester, Pennsylvania and Logan Township, 
    New Jersey. I live in Houston, Texas now and it's okay. <span class="sentence"> Sometimes I do miss home, 
    but I'm comfortable living here.</span> </p>

    <p> I don't do many things down here. I mostly like to use my computer to try to create profitable websites 
    on serivces like Wix. I'm just starting out so it isn't profitable yet. It's challenging work. </p>

    <p> Other days I work, spend time with my family, or do one of my other various hobbies. Sometime's I'll take
    a drive to get some food, or just go chill in a park, or exercise. It all depends on how I feel and what my 
    gf suggests. </p>
