    <h1>Forrest Gump</h1>

    <p>Forrest Gump wasn't like other kids. Born with "magic shoes" to help his legs and a mind that worked a little differently, he met his best friend, Jenny, on his first day of school. She saw something special in him when others didn't, helping him learn to read and shielding him from bullies.</p>

<p>Life threw a lot at Forrest – from escaping bullies and shedding those special shoes to serving in Vietnam and becoming a ping-pong champion. He even started a shrimping company with his friend Bubba and his lieutenant, Lt. Dan. After his mother passed, Lt. <span id = "Dan">_________</span> invested in Apple, making Forrest a millionaire.</p>

<p>Despite all this adventure, Forrest's heart always belonged to Jenny. They came together and drifted apart, their lives taking different paths, but their bond remained. When Jenny returned to him, needing comfort and love, Forrest was there. But heartbreak struck again when she left him, and <span id = "Forrest">_________</span>, not knowing what else to do, started running.</p>

<p>He ran across <span id = "America">_________</span> for three years, becoming a strange sort of celebrity. Then, he stopped, just as suddenly as he started. He was waiting at a bus stop when he received a letter from Jenny. He found her, and to his surprise, he met their son, Forrest Jr.</p>

<p>Sadly, <span id = "Jenny">_________</span> was sick, but they spent their last year together, getting married before she passed away. Forrest sent Forrest Jr. off to his first day of school, a proud father, as a single feather floated gently in the air. Just like the feather, Forrest's life drifted and floated, taking him to unexpected places, yet always guided by his pure heart and love for those he cherished.</p>
